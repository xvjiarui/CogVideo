The scene opens with a light gray concrete porch of a white-painted house with green accents. Two steps lead down to a teal colored concrete walkway. A light green door is in the left portion of the frame.  A window with a green shuttered window box sits above the porch. Three pink flowers in terracotta pots sit in the window box. A white painted column supports the roofline of the porch. The blue-gray cat Tom and the orange mouse Jerry are on the porch. Jerry is holding a straw Easter basket with a pink and yellow bow, with a single chocolate egg inside. Tom tries to grab the basket from Jerry. They both jump and tumble, eventually Jerry is thrown from the basket. Tom goes inside with the basket leaving Jerry dazed. He walks into the yard, off the porch. The teal walkway continues into the yard. A patch of grass is present beyond the walkway. A low brick wall lines the rear of the walkway. The grass continues past the brick wall to a fence line. Beyond the fence line sits a yellow house with green trim.  The yard is drawn with shadows from an unseen object. Jerry, still stunned, stumbles across the walkway, stopping at the edge of the grass. After a moment, he turns and runs back to the house, going inside under the door.
A white-gloved hand places a purple cup filled with orange liquid on a tiered wooden end table against a backdrop of pink wood-paneled wallpaper. The camera moves down, revealing a light blue box with two round holes on the reddish brown tabletop. The orange mouse, Jerry, pushes the box from the other side. The blue-grey cat, Tom, reaches into the frame from offscreen, holding a small yellow chick. The chick has an orange beak and feet. Tom places the chick on the table, and the chick walks toward the box. Tom picks up the box lid and places the chick inside, then closes the lid. He taps the box with his fingers, then lifts the lid again. He lowers the lid again and peers at Jerry through a hole in the box, smiling. He closes the lid once more, then taps the box with both hands and smiles at Jerry. The camera moves up slightly to reveal a small green plant with red berries hanging from the pink wood-paneled wallpaper. Tom claps Jerry's hands together repeatedly. He then brings Jerry's right hand up to his mouth and kisses it. Tom abruptly stops smiling and drops Jerry onto the table, looking offscreen in surprise. The blue box bursts open, revealing jagged blue edges. Tom clenches his teeth and shakes his fists at Jerry, then leans down and looks inside the box. He looks at Jerry angrily.
The blue-gray cat Tom peeks out from behind a bright green leafy bush. His eyes are wide with excitement. The orange mouse Jerry peeks out from behind the bush next to Tom. In the background, a clear blue river flows gently. The trees behind the river are various shades of green. The ground around the bush and the riverbank are yellow. Tom gestures with his white-gloved hand for Jerry to stay put, then gracefully leaps onto the river. Tom sinks immediately. Tom surfaces, gasping for air, and frantically dog paddles to the riverbank. The scene transitions with a slow fade, starting from the bottom of the frame, to an indoor scene. The walls are green, and Tom, soaking wet, is sprawled on a lavender upholstered armchair with his white feet extended. His yellow eyes are wide with surprise. The orange mouse Jerry is perched on the back of the armchair. A brown wooden side table sits to the right of the armchair. Concentric circles of water ripple outward from the base of the armchair.
The blue-gray cat Tom peeks his head from behind a corner with a mischievous grin, revealing a wall painted in a vibrant green hue. He clutches a red-brown rectangular object with a metal handle, his white paws contrasting against the vibrant colors. The yellow wall-mounted lamp with a bell-shaped shade casts a warm glow on the scene as Tom tiptoes into the frame, his movements sly and calculated. He then peers around the corner cautiously, his emerald green eyes wide with anticipation.  Tom, now fully emerged, leans forward, his grin widening into a mischievous smile. He holds a small, orange wind-up mouse toy with black details, its metal key glistening.  The room remains bathed in a soft light as Tom winds the key with a practiced paw, his tongue lolling out in amusement.
The blue-gray cat Tom peeks around a teal-colored door with a gold doorknob. The door swings open, revealing a green wall with white trim. Tom steps back in fright as an unseen force pushes the door open further. The orange mouse Jerry pushes the door open from the other side, slamming it into Tom. Jerry looks around and ducks behind the door as Tom's white-gloved hand reaches out from behind the door. Jerry pushes the door open again, but Tom is gone. Tom steps out from behind the door holding a yellow dustpan, which he drops on the floor, causing it to make a clanging sound. He reaches for Jerry, but Jerry jumps out of the way. Tom stumbles and falls, his face landing in the dustpan. A second blue-gray cat, identical to Tom, walks up behind Tom and steps on his tail, causing Tom to cry out in pain. The second cat walks away, leaving Tom alone with his face still in the dustpan. Jerry walks over and taps on Tom's rear end. Tom looks up, startled, and the dustpan tips over, covering his face with dust. Jerry dusts off his hands.
The black bulldog Spike, wearing a red collar, lies sleeping on a green and yellow circular rug, while the blue-gray cat Tom walks into view from the right side of the frame. Tom crouches low to the ground and begins following a trail of small black footprints across the yellow floor. He tiptoes carefully towards the sleeping bulldog, careful not to step on any of the footprints. Tom reaches Spike and gently pats him on the back with his white paw, then raises his right paw in the air, preparing to strike.  He stops, reconsidering, and begins to tiptoe backwards, away from the sleeping bulldog. Tom disappears off-screen to the right, leaving a swirling trail of dust in his wake. When the dust settles, Tom reappears from the right side of the frame, carrying a roasted chicken. Tom takes careful, tiptoeing steps back towards Spike, holding the chicken out in front of him. He steps onto the green and yellow rug and holds the chicken directly beneath Spike's nose. The scene transitions with a quick fade-out to white. The scene fades back in on the same frame as before the transition. Tom uses the chicken to slap the sleeping bulldog on the nose, and Spike's body trembles slightly. Tom quickly pulls the chicken back, and continues to slap Spike in the face with it. Tom continues to slap the sleeping bulldog in the face with the chicken, and then transitions to a full-screen view of a trail of black footprints, moving from left to right across the yellow floor. The camera pans to the right, following the footprints to the edge of a round, yellow table, where the orange mouse, Jerry, is operating a large, old fashioned movie camera. The camera is black with a silver dish on top and a large silver lens. Jerry smiles and looks through the camera’s lens. Jerry runs off-screen towards the right.
A woman with black hair, wearing a turquoise dress, sits on a large, rounded, purple upholstered armchair. She holds a yellow piece of fabric, possibly a dress, in her lap. To her left, a round, brown wooden table holds a pair of red scissors and a basket filled with multicolored balls of yarn. Behind the table, a light brown wooden fireplace with white brick surround holds two logs on its raised, black metal fire grate. Above the fireplace mantle hangs a trio of circular, gold-rimmed decorative plates on the yellow wall. The woman lifts the yellow fabric, now a fully formed dress, revealing it to be a vibrant yellow with a white collar. She holds the dress up in front of her. The blue-gray cat Tom peeks over the top of the armchair as his entire body stretches horizontally across the floor towards the dress. Tom disappears from view behind the chair and the woman gasps as his arm, now clad in the sleeve of the yellow dress, reaches up from behind the chair. Tom rises further, now standing upright behind the woman, completely enveloped within the yellow dress. He is only visible by his eyes, which are wide and staring straight ahead, and his tail, which protrudes from the bottom of the dress. The woman continues to hold the dress’ collar, her eyes closed and her head tilted back. Tom begins to dance, moving first his left arm then his right leg outward before shuffling both feet to his right. He stumbles slightly as his left foot catches on the floor. Tom exits the scene frame left, dragging the dress with him as he moves. The woman’s eyes open, revealing her shocked expression as she stares at the empty dress.
The blue-gray cat Tom, dressed in a red and yellow musketeer outfit with a white feather on his hat, holds a yellow mallet in his right paw, preparing to strike the orange mouse Jerry, who is wearing a gray suit of armor, in a room with a pale pink wall with ornate gold trim, a tall brown double door with gold trim on the left side, and pale yellow flooring. Tom swings his mallet, but Jerry ducks, causing Tom's mallet to hit the suit of armor, propelling Jerry, still wearing the helmet and hat, into the air. The metallic gray armor falls apart on the floor, separating into its component parts. Jerry flies toward the wall as Tom runs towards the camera, ending up on the left side of the double door, while Jerry's helmet falls off. Jerry is now stuck to the wall by his nose.  Tom, brandishing a silver sword with a yellow hilt, lunges towards Jerry, who detaches from the wall and runs along the ornate gold trim that lines the pale pink wall. Tom continues to swipe at Jerry with his sword.  Jerry leaps onto the silver blade of Tom's sword as Tom attempts to shake him off. Jerry, using the sword as a springboard, launches himself at Tom, knocking him backward a step.  Tom regains his balance and holds the sword straight out in front of him. Jerry walks down the length of the blade, stopping just before the tip.  Tom leans forward, bringing his face close to Jerry's.
