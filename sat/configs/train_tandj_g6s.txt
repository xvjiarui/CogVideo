The brown mouse Jerry, wearing a yellow bow, is pulled along a light blue surface by a thin, white rope. He strains against the rope, his small legs moving rapidly. As the rope pulls taut, Jerry's body stretches and contorts comically. He briefly opens his mouth wide, as if gasping for air, then resumes struggling.  The pulling continues, and Jerry's grip finally slips. He flips backward, still clinging to the rope, and dangles upside down. His body bobs slightly as he swings freely. He twists his head upward, his face contorted in discomfort.  Jerry then uses his momentum to swing back onto the platform, landing on his feet. He appears exhausted, his body trembling slightly. He wipes his brow with his tiny hand and lets out a sigh of relief. He fixes his gaze on something off-screen, his expression one of determination. Jerry winks mischievously, then clenches his teeth and resumes pulling on the rope with renewed vigor.

The blue-gray cat Tom, standing on a gray stone pavement with green hedges in the background, attempts to grab the small brown mouse Jerry. Tom kicks his leg up high, almost hitting Jerry. Tom misses and stumbles, his legs kicking in the air. Tom, regaining his balance, begins chopping at the white trellis with his hand, creating small red and blue sparks. He then runs off-screen to the right. The camera pans to the right, revealing a red armchair. Tom leaps onto the red armchair, landing with a thud. He adjusts himself into a more comfortable position in the armchair. Tom stretches his arms above his head, lets out a large sigh, and relaxes into the armchair.
The blue-gray cat Tom with a red and white striped tank top opens his mouth widely to take a bite of a hot dog held by a feminine white hand with red nail polish against a bright blue sky with stylized white clouds. Tom’s yellow eyes widen with delight as he chews the hot dog and the red nail polish disappears from the hand. Tom’s eyes become thin slits as he enjoys the hot dog. Tom closes his mouth with a look of satisfaction as he finishes the hot dog.  The hand reappears as the blue-gray cat Tom finishes the hot dog. Tom looks at the hand with a hopeful expression. The scene transitions with a cut to a beach scene. The white cat with red lipstick, green eyeshadow, and a yellow two-piece bathing suit sits with a brown beach umbrella behind her on the left. The blue-gray cat Tom is laying to her right, wearing a red one-piece bathing suit with white stripes. The blue-gray cat Tom wiggles his toes and the white cat kicks sand on him.

The blue-gray cat, Tom, has his right arm around the gray bulldog, Spike's neck. Spike has a red collar with a gold circular tag. Tom and Spike are both looking forward, with their mouths slightly open in a surprised expression. The background features a solid blue sky with no clouds, and a green hedge resembling a garden. Tom shakes Spike's head. Spike growls, his expression shifts to anger, his ears lower, and his brow furrows. He shakes Tom's head vigorously. Spike continues to growl angrily while shaking Tom's head, his eyebrows furrowing further. He holds Tom by the neck and continues to growl with his mouth open, teeth bared. Spike pulls his head back, then lunges forward, releasing Tom and sending him flying through the air, over the hedge. Spike continues to watch Tom fly away.
A woman, wearing a green dress and yellow apron, stands on a teal linoleum floor, holding a red-handled mop with a blue head. She wears red slippers and moves the mop back and forth. To her right is a white metal bucket with a red handle. The scene cuts to a grassy yard, a white garage with brown double doors on the left, and a beige stone house with brown roof, white shutters, and a white window on the right. The little brown mouse, Jerry, runs from the background towards the garage. The blue-gray cat Tom runs after him, chasing him into the grass. They both run towards the camera. Tom lunges at Jerry but misses. Tom lands in a patch of dark mud by a water faucet and gray hose. Tom’s body sinks into the mud. Tom tries to get out of the mud.
The blue-gray cat, Tom, is sprawled on his stomach in a muddy patch of grass, sliding downwards as more mud falls upon him from above. He continues sliding downwards, the momentum carrying him forward as he transitions from the muddy patch to the grassy expanse, leaving a trail in his wake. Bits of mud fling off Tom as he slides. The camera cuts to a view from inside a house, with a white-and-silver sink in the foreground. A broom leans against the wall to the left of the doorway, with a dustpan propped against the wall beneath it. Through the open door, we see Tom slide across the grass. The little brown mouse Jerry runs across the grass, stopping just before reaching the mud. Tom slides headfirst into the mud, then begins running across the grass, towards Jerry. Jerry runs away from Tom and towards the house, then back out into the yard, with Tom in hot pursuit. Jerry suddenly stops just before reaching the muddy patch, causing Tom to run face-first into the mud. Tom shakes his head, splattering mud, then continues to run after Jerry. Jerry reaches the step leading up to the house's back door and pauses, watching as Tom slides towards him through the mud. As Tom gets closer, Jerry steps to the side and into the house through the open back door, leaving Tom to slide past and into the house. Tom enters the house, leaving a trail of mud in his wake, then loses his balance and falls to the teal-colored linoleum floor. Tom lies sprawled on the floor for a moment before lifting his head.
